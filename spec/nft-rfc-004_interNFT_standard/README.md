## Synopsis

This standard describes a set of interfaces that can be utilised to build an inter-chain non-fungible token implementation.

InterNFT is a natively implemented NFT structure for Blockchain applications that implement interoperability protocols. The interNFT standard is defined by a basic interface that any NFT structure has to implement to be classified as an interNFT. The ownership of interNFT is maintained by the interNFT wallet. The combination of interNFT and interNFT wallet allows the ownership of the interNFT to be exchanged across interoperable chains while the execution logic of the NFT minting and mutation is still maintained at the native chain.

### Motivation

The current set of common NFT definitions are dominated by the [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) interface definitions which are biased towards smart contract-based definitions of NFT. A chain app code native definition of NFT may not necessarily be bound by the restrictions that a smart contract definition of NFT will be, allowing for the interface to be made simpler while adding more native implementation relevant methods. Also, the smart contract-based approach for NFT implementation does not account for a common native wallet that may hold ownership representations of multiple NFT implementations and allow for a singular transfer NFT ownership transaction implementation.

The main motivation of the standard is to:
* Define an inter-chain NFT interface that all data structures must implement to be classified as an interNFT and an interNFT wallet interface that can hold the ownership of all such interNFT implementations for an account.
* Define a base implementation of the interNFT and interNFT wallet interfaces method signatures with mint, mutate metadata and burn transactions for base NFT and ownership transfers for the base NFT wallet implementation.
* Define a metadata interface to maintain the interNFT metadata. This interface may further be utilized for storing metadata for objects from other datastructures too.
* Extend the transfer interNFT functionality of the base interNFT wallet implementation to define packet data structure, app logic and encoding for interchain interNFT ownership transfers and define the ICS specification.

This will allow all projects in the inter-chain ecosystem to:
* Define their own implementation of interNFT structures with custom mint, mutation and burn transaction logic maintained at their app chain.
* Have a common wallet implementation for all interNFT implementations which can hold ownership information of multiple kinds of interNFTs from multiple chains in a single wallet for an account.
* Natively send the ownership of interNFTs across chains through inter-chain communication protocols without a requirement for permissioned bridges or token transformation/pegging.

### Definitions

* `interNFT`: An extension of the `NFT` interface. The `interNFT` is defined to allow for maximum application logic flexibility in one interface and is focused on interchain ownership transfer. In this document `interNFT` will also refer to a basic interface, implementation of which will classify a structure as an `interNFT`

* `classification`: a representation of the type or grouping for an `interNFT`, e.g. an `interNFT` "Toyota Corolla" will be of `classification` car.

* `trait`: a charectersitic/variable related to an `interNFT` defined by `classification` e.g. "top speed" can be a `trait` of `classification` car.

* `signature`: a cryptographic signature using a private key on bytes of information. A signature can be verified against the public key of the signing private key and sign bytes. 

* `fact`: a piece of information. A `fact` can carry `signature`s from `account`(s) e.g. "100 mph (ca. 161 km/h)" is a fact and an `account` can attest it by signing it with their private key.

* `property`: the value of a `trait` is `property`. Every `property` has a `trait` identifier and a corresponding fact `fact` e.g. 

* `account`: a singularly identifiable identity of each actor on the application. An `account` is generally identified by a public key.

* `maintainers`: a group of one or more accounts that can issue and mutate `properties` of a `classification` of `interNFT`

* `interNFT wallet`: a mapping of a set of `interNFT ID`s against an `account` ID. An `interNFT wallet` specifies the `interNFT`s owned by and an account.

* `height`: the block height of the chain. Used as a measure of time for `interNFT` time-bound operations.

* `lock`: the `height` after which the `interNFT` is allowed to be transferred out of an `interNFT wallet`. 

* `burn`: the `height` after which the `interNFT` is allowed to be burned/redeemed by the owner of the `interNFT`. 

* `interNFT ID`: A reference to the `interNFT` specifying the hash of the NFT Immutable, the address of the originating chain, and the class of the NFT. The address is convertible to a String for reference.

* `immutables`: `trait`s of the `interNFT` that do not change after being issued. The hash of these properties is a  part of the NFT Address( `interNFT ID`).

* `mutables`: `trait`s of the `interNFT` that can be changed through transactions defined on it.

### Desired Properties

**Standard ownership transfer logic**
The overall NFT functionality is split into two objects, the NFT, and NFT wallet. NFT object handles the mint, mutation, and burns logic with the NFT wallet object handling the ownership transfers. Both objects can operate independently on different chains.

**Singular representation/instantiation**
The NFTs are addressed by the same hash of the immutable properties, enforcing singular representation/instantiation of NFT across chains.

**Singular wallet implementation**
NFT wallet object implements the wallet and transfer logic and is agnostic to other custom logic associated with the underlying NFT implementation allowing for a singular wallet implementation for all the defined NFT interface.

**Implementation flexibility**
The NFT interface implementation must allow for all the basic functional requirements of an NFT with no restrictions on the extension of the functionalities to account for more complex application logic, as long as the implementation satisfies the NFT interface.

**Reduce load/dependence on inter-chain protocol**
The two objects comprising the NFT functionality, NFT & NFT wallet sould not need to communicate with each other to sync their state at each transaction. They MUST function independently only with a few transactions requiring dependence on the inter-chain protocol(interchain send, burn transactions).

**Commodification**
All the NFTs are represented with a class or classification allowing for transactions to address NFTs though classes instead of direct addresses and hence allowing for NFT commodification.

**Trusted minting, mutation and burn execution and Interoperability with private chains**
The minting, mutation, and burn logic is implemented natively on the issuing chain and is always handled by the same chain instead of handing over the mutation logic to the recipient chain on an NFT ownership transfer. This allows for private and privately validated chains to also exchange their NFTs with other chains while ensuring the execution environment trust and logic privacy(if required).

**Native implementation and interoperability**
The NFT module is implemented at the native chain application logic level instead of at the Smart Contract level, leveraging the chainâ€™s native interoperability protocols to transfer NFTs between chains instead of permissioned bridge Smart Contracts. The basic interface and functionalities of the NFT may be extended by smart contracts to allow for more complex application logic.
