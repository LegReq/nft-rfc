# Requests for Comments
The process of developing Interchain Standards for NFTs and Metadata MUST allow all proposals and recommendations to proceed through an open submission and review process, which is defined as a **Request for Comments (RFC)**. 
This process should follow well-established norms and good practices for developing technical recommendations and implementation options for open technical standards.

An RFC SHOULD start as a Github issue, based on the [RFC Issue Template](https://github.com/interNFT/rfc/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RFC&template=rfc-issue.md&title=). 
New issues should be added to the Proposals & Recommendations Inbox on the [Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/interNFT/projects/3).  

For a Draft Proposal to become formally adopted as an RFC, this should be specified using [this template](https://github.com/interNFT/rfc/blob/main/0000-template.md). Fork the template file and submit as a Pull Request (PR) within the rfc repository.
Do not add an RFC number, as this will be done by the project team.

Proposals may be discussed and prepared before submission, using the [InterNFT Discord](https://discuss.internft.org/).

# RFC status
Each InterNFT RFC submitted will follow a quick-paced and structured process from draft proposal through to final recommendation, as outlined below.
After initial review by the Project Team, for triage and labeling, the issue will be tagged and may be progressed through the review phases.
Once an RFC enters the review process, this will be time-limited to 14-day review and decision cycles.

DRAFT PROPOSAL ->  14-DAY OPEN REVIEW CYCLE -> LAST CALL yyyy-mm-dd -> FINAL RECOMMENDATION 
-> ACCEPTED \\ REPLACED -> SUPERSEDED by RFCxxx
OR\-> REJECTED -> SUPERSEDED by RFCxxx

OR  \->   ABANDONED
                             
### RFC Status Tags:
DRAFT PROPOSAL: At this stage the RFC submission is work in progress, without a being ready for formal review. This should present a good initial draft on which to get feedback (so consider using Discord for earlier, formative discussions).
OPEN REVIEW: RFC is fully developed and subjected to a 14-day open review process.
LAST CALL <date for the last call>: provides a deadline after which no further updates are accepted (changes would require a new RFC to supersede).
FINAL RECOMMENDATION: RFC is either accepted or rejected for inclusion in the InterChain standard.
SUPERSEDED by RFCxxx: A new RFC replaces the last proposal.
ABANDONED: the RFC is no longer pursued by the original authors.

# Acceptance Criteria
* Does not a duplicate a pre-existing RFC, or has sufficient reason to supersede an existing RFC
* Not disputed (disputed proposals will be subjected to additonal processes)
* Technically sound and feasible, in the general opinion of reviewers
* Contributes a recommendation which is relevant to the Interchain Standard for NFTs and Metadata
* (Formal governance. Other?)

# Disputed RFCs or no visible support
Discussed in the InterNFT Working Group.
