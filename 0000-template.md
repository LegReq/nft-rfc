## Summary

Brief explanation of the recommendation or technical proposal.

## Context

Why is this recommendation needed? What use cases does it support? What problems does it solve? What are the expected outcomes if this is not done, as well as if it is implemented as proposed?
 
Describe the issues and constraints you are trying to solve in generic terms, without making it too closely coupled with a specific solution or recommendation you have in mind, so this could be used to develop alternative solutions.

## Proposal

Start by explaining your recommendation/design in a simple enough way for a non-technical reader to understand the rationale. Then provide a technical description with sufficient detail and specifications for this to be implemented by a person with the relevant expertise. 
Include usage examples and edge-cases.
Define any new terminology.

### Basic example/s

What would this look like as a recommendation statement and/or code snippet? (Omit if not relevant). 

## Consequences
What outomes could be expected if this proposal is implemented as a recommendation.
### Positive
### Negative
### Neutral

## Alternatives

What other design proposals or recommendations have been considered?

## Adoption

If the proposal is implemenented, how could this recommendation/design become broadly used as an Interchain Standard?

## Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
