## Summary

Brief explanation of the recommendation or technical proposal.

## Basic example

What would this look like as a technical description and/or code snippet? (Omit if not relevant). 

## Motivation

Why should we do this? What use cases does it support? What problems does it solve? What are the expected outcomes if this is not done, as well as if it is implemented as proposed?
 
Describe the issues and constraints you are trying to solve in generic terms (without coupling too closely with the solution or recommendation you have in mind).
If this specific RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions.

## Detailed Recommendation, or solution design

Explain your recommendation and design simply enough for someone who is not familiar with how this could be technically implemented, to understand the rationale. Then provide enough detail and specifications for this to be implemented by someone with the relevant technical expertise. 
Include usage examples and edge-cases.
Define any new terminology.

## Drawbacks of the proposal

Why should we not do this?

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

##Â Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how could this become broadly used as an Interchain Standard?

## Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
